    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>It's your birthday today.</p>
    <p>I uh- I couldn't reach you.</p>
    <p>Are you asleep?</p>
    <p>Listen</p>
    <p>I asked if I could tell you this and they said no</p>
    <p>But I'm gonna tell you anyway</p>
    <p>We have a surprise planned for you</p>
    <p>A whole party and cake</p>
    <p>Ice cream cake, your favorite</p>
    <p>I had to go to so many different stores to find it</p>
    <p>The best cake for the best person</p>
    <p>You deserve it, all of this</p>
    <p>Hey</p>
    <p>I'm running out of time so uh</p>
    <p>Call me back when you get this</p>
    <p>I love you</p>
